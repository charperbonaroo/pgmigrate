Charper Bonaroo's PostGres Migrate tool

Screw DSLs. Write migrations using plain SQL.

  recreate  Fastest way to start fresh: Drop if exists, then create and migrate

  migrate   Create database if not exists, then run the `up.sql` files for the
            migrations and add them to the list of completed migrations, sorted
            naturally.

  rollback  Run `down.sql` (if exists) for all migrations executed in the last
            `migrate`-call (even if the folder had no `up.sql` file) in reverse
            order.

  init      Create the .cbpgm.js config file & migrations directory
  config    Print the current postgres config
  help      Render this help-text
  list      Print the list of migrations and their status

  createdb  Create the postgres database (without migrations)
  dropdb    Delete the postgres database.

This tool allows you to write migration scripts in plain SQL. You create your
migration by creating a folder containing a `up.sql` and `down.sql` file. The
migrations (i.e. the `up.sql` files) will be executed in their containing
folder's natural sort order. Migrations will only be executed once unless
they've been rolled back. The `up.sql` and `down.sql` files are both optional.

Sorting of migrations is done using a NATURAL ORDER. Wikipedia writes:

Example folder structure:

  migrations/
    1-add-users/
      up.sql
      down.sql
    2-add-posts/
      up.sql
      down.sql
    3-add-comments/
      up.sql
      down.sql
    12-add-categories/
      up.sql
      down.sql
    13-add-votes/
      up.sql
      down.sql
    101-add-reports/
      up.sql
      down.sql
